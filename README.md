## Questions to Answer

What is the difference between size and capacity?
Size is the current number of elements in the list while capacity is the maximum number of elements that list can hold. 
When do we resize and why?
When the size = capacity and want to add more elements in order to increase capacity so that the condition size <= capacity remains true. 
Which operations require shifting and why?
remove and add because because inserting or removing an element in the middle of the list changes the positions of the elements that come after it. 

## Reflection 

Please provide a brief reflection about your experience with this assignment. What was easiest? What was hardest? How did your understanding of arrays and lists evolve?
I wrote 99% of this in one night even after submitting an extension so I will not do that again hopefully. The easiest part was honestly writing out the methods and tests once I understood the assignment. The hardest part was getting started esp with the constructor and the attributes--for some reason I was just really confused. My understanding of adding to and removing from arrays changed as I now understand what we covered in Thursday's class with the steps to adding and removing lists.
