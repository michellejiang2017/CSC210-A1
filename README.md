## Questions to Answer

What is the difference between size and capacity?
Size is the current number of elements in the list while capacity is the maximum number of elements that list can hold. 
When do we resize and why?
When the size = capacity and want to add more elements in order to increase capacity so that the condition size <= capacity remains true. 
Which operations require shifting and why?
remove and add because because inserting or removing an element in the middle of the list changes the positions of the elements that come after it.

I wrote 99% of this in one night even after submitting an extension so I will not do that again hopefully.
